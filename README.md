# Automated Environment Configurations

Lei Mao

## Introduction

This repository is a collection of environment configuration bash scripts for fresh systems. The bash scripts could be used for Dockerfiles and cloud VM instances to get better setup reproducibility and efficiency. All the scripts have been tested on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). They should also work well on Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure Cloud, and other cloud service providers.
